# System Development Investigation

The goal of this file is the capture the various sensors, prototyping platforms, languages, frameworks, OSs, communication protocols, actuators and their corresponding integrations that drive the creation of non-trivial "connected devices" systems. At the end of this investigation we hope to have a repository of well documented pages that provide insight into the function of these various elements and how they can be implemented into useful systems.
